# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## overview of analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to analyze the employee database for Pewlett Hackard & assist them in determining how many employees are up for retirement.

## Analysis Deliverables

The two main points of the analysis are to look at the total number of employees who are eligible for retirement & also the number of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program to up and coming employees. 

## Findings

41380 employees will be eligible for retirement.

Only 1940 employees are born between 1965-01-01 to 1965-12-31. This is the count of employees eligible for the mentorship program.

There are not enough employees eligible for the mentorship program to support the number of eligible employees for retirement. 

If Pewlett Hackard increases the age of the mentorship program - they may have more current employees even if they are eligible for retirement who may want to assist with the mentorship program.
